              The Made in Arnhem Land (MIA) Certification System upholds authenticity, quality, and cultural integrity.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Certification is voluntary but strongly encouraged. Certified sellers gain permission to use the MIA brand
              and the &ldquo;100% Arnhem Land Certified&rdquo; logo, and access to VIP promotional services.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Certification ensures protection of Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (ICIP), promotes ethical
              trade, and supports transparent sourcing. It includes criteria covering authenticity, cultural integrity,
              quality standards, and ethical practices. Certification is valid for two years and renewable through review.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Certification Requirements</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Certified sellers receive permission to use the 100% Arnhem Land Certification logo only in connection

              Sellers must confirm orders promptly and dispatch goods within stated timeframes. Packaging must be

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Authority to Leave (ATL) Deliveries</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Where a buyer selects or agrees to &ldquo;Authority to Leave&rdquo; delivery instructions, the delivery
              carrier may leave the package at the delivery address without obtaining a signature from the recipient.
              By selecting this option, the buyer acknowledges and accepts that the package may be left unattended
              at the delivery location.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The Marketplace and the seller are not responsible for loss, theft, or damage to packages after they
              have been delivered in accordance with the Authority to Leave instructions provided by the buyer.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Buyers who do not wish to use Authority to Leave should ensure that an attended delivery option or
              signature requirement is selected where available.

            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              All transactions are governed by Australian Consumer Law. Products must be of acceptable quality,
              fit for purpose, and match their description. Sellers must accept returns or issue refunds where
              goods are faulty, not as described, or undelivered.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Disputes should be resolved directly between buyer and seller. If unresolved, the Marketplace may
              mediate and, if necessary, refer matters to consumer protection authorities. Sellers should respond
              to return or refund requests within a reasonable timeframe and aim to resolve disputes promptly in
              accordance with Australian Consumer Law.

            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Sellers pay a monthly licence fee (in advance) and a sales commission invoiced monthly in arrears.
              Advertising and optional service fees may also apply. Licence fees secure access to platform tools
              and support. Commission invoices must be paid within 14 days.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Non-payment may result in suspension or termination. Ask for detailed fees schedule. Sellers are
              responsible for their own tax compliance. Funds are reconciled monthly. Accounts with repeated
              non-payment may be terminated.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The Marketplace reserves the right to temporarily withhold payments where necessary to investigate
              suspected fraud, certification misuse, chargebacks, or other breaches of these Terms.

            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              If a monthly license fee remains unpaid for 14 days beyond the due date, the seller will receive a
              written reminder. Failure to pay within a further seven (7) days may result in automatic suspension
              of listings and account access until payment is made in full.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Overdue Commission Invoices</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Commission invoices not paid within 30 days of issue may incur late-payment interest at the standard
              commercial rate and trigger account suspension.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Repeated Non-Payment</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Repeated or extended non-payment (two or more consecutive billing cycles) may lead to termination
              under Section 13, loss of certification, and withdrawal of advertising privileges.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Reinstatement</h3>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">

            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The Marketplace acts as an intermediary and is not liable for product quality, authenticity, or
              delivery delays. Liability is limited to the total value of fees paid by the seller in the previous
              six (6) months.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Sellers indemnify the Marketplace against any claim or loss arising from their conduct, listings,
              or breach of these Terms. Neither party will be held liable for events outside their control,
              including natural disasters, transport disruptions, or government restrictions.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">

            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Accounts may be suspended or terminated for breaches, non-payment, or repeated disputes. Sellers
              may also withdraw voluntarily by written notice. Upon termination, all branding rights and access
              are revoked, but financial obligations remain.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Appeals may be submitted in writing within 14 days of termination notice. Reinstatement is at
              the discretion of MIA Marketplace management.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              In the event of account suspension or termination, sellers remain responsible for fulfilling any
              outstanding confirmed orders unless otherwise agreed with the buyer or directed by the Marketplace.
